A GameObject
 is an object in the Unity Editor which contains components. Components define the behaviour of that GameObject.

This page describes how to view and interact with components, and provides a brief overview of the most common component configurations in Unity.

To view a GameObjectâ€™s components, select the GameObject in the Scene
 window or Hierarchy window, then see the Inspector
 window for a list of all components and their settings.

You can interact with components directly in the Editor, or through script. See the Scripting section for guidance on how to control and interact with components through script.
